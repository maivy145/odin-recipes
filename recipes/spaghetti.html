    <p>Quick and easy spaghetti using canned corned beef and bottled spaghetti sauce. Delicious! For added nutrition, add a can of mixed vegetables or cut-up fresh vegetable, such as chopped onion or green peppers and tomatoes.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces spaghetti</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) can corned beef</li>
        <li>1 cup spaghetti sauce</li>
        <li>1 cube chicken bouillon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder (Optional)</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon dried minced onion (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Dissolve bouillon in boiling water. Cut spaghetti noodles in half and add to boiling water until done.</li>
        <li>Over medium heat empty can of corned beef onto a skillet. Add spaghetti sauce to meat. Stir until heated; corned beef will come apart and a thick sauce will form. If desired, add Italian seasoning, garlic powder, dry onion, or any other spices.</li>
        <li>Once noodles are done, drain and combine with corned beef sauce.</li>
    </ol>
